“Golden Pot” is a challenging and addictive physics-based puzzler iPad game that teases everybody’s brain. Strategically pop the objects to swerve the golden coins into the pot. Each object that is destroyed costs one point. The strategy is: destroy as few objects as you can, while collecting all the coins into the pot, but do not let them drop onto the ground.
