!["mySlide" jQuery Slideshow plugin](/img/screen-shot-2012-07-04-at-21.27.30-1024x549-1.jpg "\"mySlide\" jQuery Slideshow plugin")

While developing my skills in JavaScript and in the jQuery framework I decided that as I go trough the learning process to apply my knowledge in a practical project. Therefore I made a simple slideshow plugin that comes with the following features:

• Slide animation completely customisable (duration, boolean for auto-slide)\
• Dynamic sizing for the set of images\
• Can be skinned with CSS to match any website theme
