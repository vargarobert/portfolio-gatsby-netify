A part client, part academic, project that involves building within a team of 6 interdisciplinary members an iOS/Android App (incl. Web Services), a cross-platform Web App and a CMS-driven website with the purpose of supporting Engineering and Computing students and staff from Coventry University.

My role in the team is to develop the native iOS application, along with one of the other peers.
