During my first year at Coventry University I was assigned as part of the Content Design Tools and Techniques module to create the following: a 3D still image, a 3D animation and a 3D single player game.

I quickly learned my way around how to use the Cinema 4D software. Poly modelling, NURBS and texturing different types of objects was very easy for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the biggest challenge that I faced for this project was modelling the sofa, as this took me 2 days of work.

By the end of this project I felt that I have gained valuable skills in 3D modelling and I have also improved my knowledge concerning theoretical terms that this type of art involves. With the experience that I have obtained, I have pushed my work further into development and I transformed my still image and animation into stereoscopic ones.
