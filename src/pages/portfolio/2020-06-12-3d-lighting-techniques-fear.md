Lighting is an integral part of 3D modelling and animation. The mood of a scene is dictated by the intensity, colour and processing of the lighting effects. It’s important as a 3D modeller to demonstrate control over this tool. Modern 3D modelling programs have an array of lighting tools, creating the desired effect can be confusing. In this project it is demonstrate the ability to create <strong>Spot</strong> and <strong>Volumetric</strong> <strong>lighting </strong>in an animated scene to a particular brief.
