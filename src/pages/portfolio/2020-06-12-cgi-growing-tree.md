3D compositing is a process by which various elements, often including both live action film footage or photographs and virtual computer-generated images, are layered and composited together into a single image or scene. Within this project the following techniques have been combined, in order to composite live footage with a 3D modelled and animated tree:

1. Static live shot with static (non mobile) computer animation.
2. Multiple angle static live shots, with cuts, matched with matched angle animation.
3. Motion live camera (mobile framing) with matched mobile animation.
4. Motion live camera (mobile framing) with cuts, with matched mobile animation with cuts.

Software: Cinema 4D, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro
