An incomplete game by James Shuttleworth that I upgraded with the following features for the final part of the 112CR - Programming Concepts and Practice portfolio:

<ul>
 	<li>“Arrow keys” for movement and the “Escape key” to quit</li>
 	<li>Collision between the player and the rocks</li>
 	<li>Margins (the player stays permanently on the screen)</li>
 	<li>The cursor is hided (it does not overlay the window where the game is running)</li>
 	<li>“Start” and “Game over” menus</li>
 	<li>Score and Top score</li>
 	<li>Sound effects</li>
</ul>
