It is often seen as the holy grail of 3d animation to create and rig a character model. In the first phase of this project I design and produce a fully rigged model ready for animation. The process started with the creation of extremely accurate reference images for the character. The images served as a template for the project. A bone structure with suitable constraints within the character mesh was created for rigging purposes.

In the second phase of the project, the keyframe animation tehnique was used in order to animate the character.

Software: Cinema 4D, Adobe Photoshop
