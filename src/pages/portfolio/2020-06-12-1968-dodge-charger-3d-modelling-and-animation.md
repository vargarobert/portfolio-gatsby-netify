Vehicle modelling is a task that 3d modellers will have on a regular basis. The reasons vary from games, movies or production animation. Vehicles are well suited to 3d Modelling and animation due to constrained shapes and mechanical movement being easy to replicate. For this project I choose to model a 1968 Dodge Charger.

The vehicle was modelled by using the poly modelling tehnique and blueprints. The vechile animation was realised by using the car rigging tehnique for steering, suspenssion, velocity.

Software: Cinema 4D, Adobe Photoshop
